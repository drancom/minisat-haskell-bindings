TODO

Make the following API:s

* a "raw" API, with nice names, but everything explicit

* a corresponding typed API, that does not allow mixing of Lits

* a Sat-monad, with one implicit Solver (lazy and strict variants)

* a Sat-monad, with many explicit Solvers (lazy and strict variants)

To think about:

Which of these needs ForeignPtr automatic garbage collection? Perhaps
already the first API?
